Captain Anderson: [question=0]Good day, young one, you must be little Gorion. My name is Captain Anderson. I served under your father in Her Majesty's Army.
[choice]I remember, sir. I heard you died in the Great War?
[choice]I don't know you. Can you please get out of my house.

Captain Anderson: No, I didn't.
Captain Anderson: I am afraid I have bad news about your father. He seems to be invisible.
Gorion: What?
Captain Anderson: Yes, you can go talk to him now, he is in bed, but you won't see him. You'll only hear him… For he is…
Gorion: Invisible, sure.

Captain Anderson: Heh, that's funny. Anyway, there is something I have to tell you.
Captain Anderson: I am afraid your father is sick. Actually, he seems to be invisible.
Gorion: What?
Captain Anderson: Yes, you can go talk to him now, he is in bed, but you won't see him. You'll only hear him… For he is...
Gorion: Invisible, sure.
