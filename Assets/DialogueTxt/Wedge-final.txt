Wedge: Hello stranger, name's Wedge. What can I do for ya'?
Gorion: Can you help me, I seem to be lost. I am looking for a looter, a thief named Biggs.
Wedge: Ah, yes... You see, that is a friend of mine. Or, that WAS a friend of mine. We used to ride together, back when he was a bit friendlier.
Wedge: Heh, we were a happy bunch.
Gorion: Ok, cool. What is his deal now?
Wedge: Well, that dirty merchant Patches tricked us out of all our loot. Biggs went crazy after that. Said he'd rob everyone 100 miles around.
Gorion: I see.
Wedge: Anyway, he needs to be stopped. I will give you this amulet. With it you just have to touch him and he will die.
Gorion equips the amulet
Gorion: Oh, OK. I didn't know it was that easy. Thank you, Wedge.
Wedge: Nevermind, just get it over with.

Wedge: I'm busy. I can't talk to you.

Wedge: Leave me be, I am in mourning.
